# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
## Step 1:
Using import math function,do the calculations.

## Step 2:
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.

## Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula Alt text

## Step 4:
Using the print function, display the distance between the two points.

## Step 5:
End the program.

list1=[10,6]
list2=[4,2]
d=((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)**0.5
print(round(d,2))
```
